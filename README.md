# C# Exercises for Begginers

Each folder contains solutions of exercises for begginer students. In every folder there are three other folders:
- TLS - solution using Top Level Statements (procedural programming)
- OOP - Object Oriented Programming solution
- WinForms - solution using Windows Forms (application)

## Exercises

Each exercise must check for input errors and return an error if it is not correct.
Each exercise must follow the rule that the user is dumb and the program must say clearly what type of input it requires and what it outputs.

1. "Hello world!" - running the program must show in console/application window the text "Hello world!"
    - Input - none
    - Output - string "Hello world!"

2. The user enters as input his/her name and the program shows in the console/app window the text "Hello, [user name]! Nice to meet you!"
    - Input - string [some user name], i.e. "John"
    - Output - "Hello, John! Nice to meet you!"
  
3. The user enters two numbers and the program outputs the sum of two
    - Input - two integers
    - Output - the sum of the two digits (integer)

4. Unit converter - the user enters integer in meters and the program returns how many yards and how many miles it equals
    - Input - integer number
    - Output - string "[entered number] meters equals [calculated] yards and [calculated] miles"

5. Words/characters calculator - the user enters arbitrarily long text and the program returns how many words and how many characters it is (space between words is not a character)
    - Input - string
    - Output - string "The text contains [calculated] words and [calculated] characters."

6. The user enters 10 random integers and the programs shows them ordered smaller to larger.
    - Input - 10 integers
    - Output - 10 integers sorted from smaller to larger

7. Magic 8-th ball - when the user starts the program it tells him/her to think of a question and to press any key (or Enter). Then it shows random "answer" to the question.
    - Input - none (just press any key)
    - Output - random string from predefined answers

8. Rock-Paper-Scissors - The user enters "R" for "Rock", "P" for "Paper" or "S" for "Scissors" then the program chooses random from the same and then shows who wins
    - Input - character R/P/S
    - Output - string "Computer choose Rock/Paper/Scissors. [User/Computer] wins! *or* It's a draw!"

9. The user enters random integer and the program returns it as words
    - Input - integer (i.e. 10000)
    - Output - string ("The number 10000 is written with words as Ten Thousand")
